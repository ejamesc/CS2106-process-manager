##CS2106 Project: Process and Resource Management

Implement a portion of the kernel that deals with management of processes and resources.

Build:

* Process: create/destroy
* Resource: request/release
* Time-out interrupt
* A presentation shell

Build it in whatever language you want. (So I chose Go)
